# EventTimer
Generalized version of the SignalGenerator component used in Auxilo2.

This component could be used to schedule unspecified events. Component is Qt-based, and requires the QtCore, QtXml and QtSql 
modules and compiler supporting C++11 standard. Except for those, the component does not require other libraries, and could be 
easily be used in a microservice-like application or as a component in a larger system.
