# EventTimer
Generalized version of the SignalGenerator component used in Auxilo2.

This component could be used to schedule events, and receive notifications when these occur. Component is Qt-based, and requires the QtCore and QtSql modules and a compiler supporting C++11 standard. Except for those, the component does not require other libraries, and could be easily be used in a microservice-like application or as a component in a larger system.

More detailed description will be found in the wiki-page and in the doxygen documentation. To generate doxygen documentation, run doxygen in the EventTimer directory. Doxyfile is provided there.

This project has finished and is no longer under active developement.
